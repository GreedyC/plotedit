"""A gel code is the same filter however it is punctuated.

    cd server && python3 test_gel_keys.py

🔴 gels.csv keys all 498 rows WITHOUT punctuation — R33, L142. Plots and imported
paperwork commonly write the dashed form. A house rep plot read into plotedit came
in as R-37, L-142, R-54 and R-05, and every one missed the table.

⚠ IT FAILED HONESTLY, WHICH IS WHY NOBODY NOTICED. A missing gel returns no
factor and a note saying so, rather than a wrong number — so the plot simply had
no footcandle figure anywhere, for a fortnight, and nothing looked broken. On the
Big House sample that was 106 coloured units and not one transmission between
them.
